## DESCRIPTION
A simple application that takes an input for a note title and some text. After both inputs are populated a save button appears; it will save the note on the server and make it available in a note list. The save button may either update an existing note or, if a completely new note, save it and append it to the list. A new note is started with a click of the "NEW" button. 


## TODOs
- Create Dark/Light Mode toggle
- Fix footer overall
- Add "updated / saved" text when action occurs
